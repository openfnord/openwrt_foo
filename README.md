# openwrt_foo

This is a collection of stuff that I created or found (random mac)
to make my live easier using a zoo of old plastic routers to
unlash the magic of a "distributed" vlan switch / router infrastructure
that spans the whole house

openwrt is cool but needs some improvements and these can be very
simple, pragmatic and useful.

Just get inspired by the small collection and feel free to 
fork it and to contribute to it.
Also it might be a cool idea to generate/modify these shell scripts
with ansible on a fake machine which has python which then writes the
generated scripts to the routers.

Hopefully the maintainers of openwrt.org get inspired by it to improve
openwrt the one or the other way.

have fun with your routers and make sure that $your_friendly_government
does not hack your stuff :-)
